# blockchain_project

<p>This is my project of creating a blockchain using sockets. Currently using ports on localhosts, but later I'll build it to work live. This project is not following any tutorials, so every solution is figured out by me and the information I've dug from google.</p>

## To do

* Add cryptographic functions like sha265 and ECDSA.
* Build a proper communication system between nodes like Gossip protocol to prevent flooding
* Stress test the system and find edge cases that might crash the system.
* Introduce a database to hold the list of transactions (Currently using a simple text file)
